SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Represents an Active Directory Computer object with methods for management and manipulation.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The ADComputer class is a wrapper around Active Directory computer objects. It encapsulates
    properties retrieved from AD and provides methods for querying, enabling, disabling, moving,
    renaming, and deleting computer objects in Active Directory. All methods interact directly
    with AD using standard PowerShell Active Directory cmdlets.

    The class supports three constructor patterns to accommodate different use cases:
    - Basic instantiation with computer name only
    - Enhanced instantiation with custom credentials
    - Full control with custom credentials and target domain controller

CONSTRUCTORS
    ADComputer([string]$Name)
        Creates an instance with the specified computer name only.
        Uses default credentials from the current session.

    ADComputer([string]$Name, [PSCredential]$Credential)
        Creates an instance with the specified computer name and credentials.
        Credentials will be used for all AD operations.

    ADComputer([string]$Name, [PSCredential]$Credential, [string]$DomainController)
        Creates an instance with computer name, credentials, and target domain controller.
        Allows querying a specific domain controller in multi-forest or multi-domain scenarios.

PROPERTIES
    ComputerName [string]

    IPv4Address [string]
        The IPv4 address associated with the computer object.

    SID [string]
        The security identifier (SID) of the computer object.

    Created [datetime]
        The date and time when the object was created in Active Directory.

    Modified [datetime]
        The date and time when the object was last modified.

    MemberOf [System.Collections.Generic.List[string]]

METHODS
    Get()
        Retrieves the computer object from Active Directory and populates all properties.
        Queries the AD using Get-ADComputer and updates the object with current values.

        Example:
            $computer = [ADComputer]::new('PC001')
            $computer.Get()
            Write-Output $computer.OperatingSystem

    Enable()
        Enables the computer account in Active Directory.
        Sets the Enabled property to $true.

        Example:
            $computer = [ADComputer]::new('PC001')
            $computer.Enable()

    Disable()
        Disables the computer account in Active Directory.
        Sets the Enabled property to $false.

        Example:
            $computer = [ADComputer]::new('PC001')
            $computer.Disable()

    Move([string]$TargetOU)
        Moves the computer object to a different Organizational Unit (OU).
        Requires the distinguished name of the target OU.

        Example:
            $computer = [ADComputer]::new('PC001')
            $computer.Get()
            $computer.Move('OU=Workstations,OU=Computers,DC=contoso,DC=com')

    Delete()
        Deletes the computer object from Active Directory.
        WARNING: This is a destructive operation and cannot be undone.

        Example:
            $computer = [ADComputer]::new('PC001')
            $computer.Delete()

    Update()
        Updates the computer object properties in Active Directory.
        Only Description and Location properties are currently updateable via this method.
        Modify the properties directly, then call Update() to persist changes.

        Example:
            $computer = [ADComputer]::new('PC001')
            $computer.Get()
            $computer.Description = 'Conference Room Printer'
            $computer.Location = 'Building A, Room 101'
            $computer.Update()

    Rename([string]$NewName)
        Renames the computer object in Active Directory.
        Updates the ComputerName property after successful rename.

        Example:
            $computer = [ADComputer]::new('PC001')
            $computer.Rename('PC002')

    Refresh()
        Refreshes all properties by re-fetching data from Active Directory.
        Calls Get() internally to reload current data without creating a new object.

        Example:
            $computer = [ADComputer]::new('PC001')
            $computer.Get()
            # ... time passes ...
            $computer.Refresh()

    GetGroupMembership()
        Retrieves all group memberships for the computer object.
        Returns a System.Collections.Generic.List[string] of group distinguished names.

        Example:
            $computer = [ADComputer]::new('PC001')
            $groups = $computer.GetGroupMembership()
            $groups | ForEach-Object { Write-Output $_ }

    ToString()
        Returns the computer name as the string representation of the object.

        Example:
            $computer = [ADComputer]::new('PC001')
            Write-Output $computer.ToString()

EXAMPLES
    Basic Usage:
        # Create a computer object and retrieve its properties
        $pc = [ADComputer]::new('WORKSTATION-01')
        $pc.Get()
        Write-Output "Computer: $($pc.ComputerName), OS: $($pc.OperatingSystem)"

    Enable/Disable Computer:
        # Disable a computer account
        $pc = [ADComputer]::new('LAPTOP-123')
        $pc.Disable()
        Write-Output "Computer disabled: $($pc.Enabled)"

    Move Computer to Different OU:
        # Reorganize computers by moving to appropriate OUs
        $pc = [ADComputer]::new('PC-OLD')
        $pc.Get()
        $pc.Move('OU=Archived,OU=Workstations,DC=contoso,DC=com')

    Update Computer Properties:
        # Update description and location information
        $pc = [ADComputer]::new('WORKSTATION-05')
        $pc.Get()
        $pc.Description = 'Engineering Department Workstation'
        $pc.Location = 'Building C, Floor 3, Room 305'
        $pc.Update()

    Query Group Memberships:
        # Check which groups a computer belongs to
        $pc = [ADComputer]::new('SERVER-01')
        $groups = $pc.GetGroupMembership()
        foreach ($group in $groups)
        {
            Write-Output "Member of: $group"
        }

    With Custom Credentials:
        # Use specific credentials for multi-forest scenarios
        $cred = Get-Credential
        $pc = [ADComputer]::new('PC-REMOTE', $cred, 'DC.remote.forest.local')
        $pc.Get()

NOTE
    - Requires the Active Directory PowerShell module (part of RSAT)
    - Minimum PowerShell version: 7.0
    - All methods will throw errors on failure; proper error handling is recommended
    - Methods use -ErrorAction Stop internally, so try-catch blocks are advised
    - All operations require appropriate Active Directory permissions
    - The Credential parameter is hidden and not returned by default display

TROUBLESHOOTING
    Object not found:
        If Get() throws an error about the object not being found, verify:
        - The computer name is spelled correctly
        - The computer exists in the specified domain
        - You have permissions to query Active Directory

    Access Denied:
        Ensure you have the necessary Active Directory permissions:
        - Read permissions for Get operations
        - Modify permissions for Enable/Disable/Update/Rename operations
        - Delete permissions for Delete operations
