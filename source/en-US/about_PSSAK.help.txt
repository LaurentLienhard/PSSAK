SHORT DESCRIPTION
    PSSAK (PowerShell Swiss Army Knife) is a PowerShell resource module providing
    foundational utilities for other modules: logging, progress bars, output
    formatting, and more.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    PSSAK is designed to be imported as a dependency by other PowerShell modules.
    It provides a consistent, tested, and ready-to-use set of utility functions
    so that common boilerplate does not need to be reimplemented in every module.

    Current capabilities:
        - Write-PSSAKProgressBar : Display a progress bar with automatic percentage
          calculation and optional estimated time remaining (ETA).

    All public functions follow the naming convention: <Verb>-PSSAK<Noun>.
    All functions are documented in English, French, German, and Portuguese.

EXAMPLES
    PS C:\> Import-Module PSSAK

    PS C:\> $files = Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Logs
    PS C:\> $start = [datetime]::UtcNow
    PS C:\> $i = 0
    PS C:\> foreach ($file in $files)
    PS C:\> {
    PS C:\>     $i++
    PS C:\>     Write-PSSAKProgressBar -Activity 'Processing' -Current $i -Total $files.Count -StartTime $start
    PS C:\> }
    PS C:\> Write-PSSAKProgressBar -Activity 'Processing' -Completed

NOTE:
    Requires PowerShell 7.0 or higher.
